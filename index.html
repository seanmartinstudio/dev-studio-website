            <div class="category-copy">
                <p>We don’t prescribe to any single design strategy, because every client and collaboration is unique. However, we have three design tenents that guide us. </p>

                <h4>Color</h4>
                <p>Color choices and paring can communicate so much without saying a word. Two colors together communicate conviction, while three or more colors communicate depth.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="two">
                <h4>Typography</h4>
                <p>The visual rhythm of written language. Font styles and pairings can communicate authority on a subject. Serif feels like New York Times – San Serif feels like Nike.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="three">
                <h4>Photography</h4>
                <p>This is a hot take, but we believe a website is only as good as its photography. Humans connect with images on such a primordial level and a picture is worth a thousand words. Well composed and executed images of products and people can persuade a person to click “buy” or remember you and your website. </p>
